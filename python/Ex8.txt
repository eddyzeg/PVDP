“The idea of giving computers the ability to process human language is as old as the idea of computers themselves. This book is about the implementation and implications of that exciting idea. We introduce a vibrant interdisciplinary field with many names corresponding to its many facets, names like speech and language processing, human language technology, natural language processing, computational linguistics, and speech recognition and synthesis. The goal of this new field is to get computers to perform useful tasks involving human language, tasks like enabling human-machine communication, improving human-human communication, or simply doing useful processing of text or speech.”
